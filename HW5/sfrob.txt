We used sampleFile as a randommly created 5MB file. (the same one as the previously used file)

time ./sfrob < sampleFile > dump

real 0m0.195s
user 0m0.120s
sys  0m0.004s

time ./sfrobu < sampleFile > dump

real 0m0.142s
user 0m0.052s
sys  0m0.020s

time ./sfrobs.sh < sampleFile > dump

real  0m0.305s
user  0m0.172s
sys   0m0.008s

We can see from these tests that when given an input file, that the system
call sfrob is about the same speed as normal sfrob. This might happen because
of optimizatons in the program itself however, as it takes much longer system time.
If optimized, it is probable that ./sfrob is faster than ./sfrobu.

We also can see that the sh file take much longer. This is probably because it
has to translate all the characters between xor42, which would naturally take longer.

time ./sfrobu -f < sampleFile > dump

real 0m0.153s
user 0m0.056s
sys  0m0.016s

time ./sfrobs.sh -f < sampleFile > dump

real  0m0.391s
user  0m0.312s
sys   0m0.000s

This confirms our analysis of the previous cases. We can see that ./sfrobs takes
longer due to having to translate each character twice (there and back).
