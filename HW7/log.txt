dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

   This was done on both computers so as to install
   openssh (although technically, it would have sufficed
   for the server computer to install openssh-server
   and the client to instal openssh-client)

ssh-keygen

   creates the public/private rsa key pair, which I
   created without a passphrase.

Server Actions:

sudo useradd -d /home/test -s test 

   creates a directory named test, along with a user named test

sudo passwd test

   initialzes the password for the test account, which I set
   to be password

cd /home/test
sudo mkdir .ssh

   creates the ssh directory

sudo chown -R test .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

   allows the test account to log into the server and gives him the
   necessary permissions.

emacs /etc/ssh/sshd.config

   disabling the PasswordAuthentication

Client Actions:

ssh-copy-id -i test@10.0.2.15
ssh add

   This copies the public key over the server and adds the private key

ssh -X test@10.0.2.15

   enters the server

gedit

   opens gedit on the server
