Patching the ls command

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
   this downloads the coreutils package from the link provided

tar -zxvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
   this extracts the file

mkdir Coreutilsinstall
   creates a folder that will later be necessary
   
cd coreutils-7.6
   moves to coreutils-7.6 folder (created in step 2)

emacs INSTALL -nw
   opens the INSTALL text that explains how to configure the file

./configure --prefix=/home/agrove25/CS35L/HW3/Coreutilsinstall/
   configures the file, which we learnt in step 5 required the
   absolute path to another unrelated folder for some reason.
   This step is necessary to set it up for make, as it builds and
   customizes the makefile.

make
   builds the software (automatically runs all, the first rule,
   and its dependencies)

emacs mypatch -nw
   creates patch file

(was not able to copy and paste into emacs and have it formatted
correctly, so I used notepad++ to copy and paste the patch into
the mypatch file)

patch -p1 <mypatch
   patched the files that mypatch declared (the file NEWS and src/ls.c)

make
   rebuilds the software (automatically runs all, the first rule,
   and its dependencies)

Testing

./ls ../../testFolder -l

     Pre-patch:
     drwxrwxr-x 2 agrove25 agrove25 4096 2017-01-25 11:17 .
     drwxrwxr-x 5 agrove25 agrove25 4096 2017-01-29 11:18 ..
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 agrove25 agrove25    4 2017-01-25 11:16 hi
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 agrove25 agrove25    4 2005-05-01 00:00 hi2

     Post-patch:
     drwxrwxr-x 2 agrove25 agrove25 4096 Jan 25 11:17 .
     drwxrwxr-x 5 agrove25 agrove25 4096 Jan 29 11:02 ..
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 agrove25 agrove25    4 Jan 25 11:16 hi
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 agrove25 agrove25    4 May  1  2005 hi2

As we can see, there is an obvious change with the date format between
the two. The first has the added benefit of displaying the time in
files one year older, something that the post-patch does not do.
