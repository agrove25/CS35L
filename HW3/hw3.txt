Questions for Lab3

1. I don't believe it was necessary to remove
case_long_iso_time_style because the patch removes the only reference
to it, which is within the for loop. As long as the for loop is
removed, then I don't think the existance of the
case_long_iso_time_style has any impact on the running of ls.c

2. There are two downsides that are evident with this format of
dates. The first, is that for files that are greater than a year old,
the time is replaced by the year, so users that desire a more detailed
view on older filews ill be unhappy. Secondly, due to the month naming
conventions, i.e. Mar or May, users from other countries might not
understand the dat that is being referred to, as they might not speak
english. (This is assuming that locale isn't changed, which may play
an impact on this date system).

3. Python2:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 275, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError
       if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This occurs because a null file is just that, null. As such, when the
array self.lines is initialized, its size is 0. This leads to issues
when the code desires to take a random element from this array, as
there are no elements for it to choose from, resulting in an
out-of-range error.

4. Python3:

File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):

According to PEP 3110 in the Python3 documentation, this error is due
to a change in syntax to deal with exceptions. The comma syntax is no
longer permitted, and instead needs to take the form

except TypeError as exc: (where exc is an exception obejct)
