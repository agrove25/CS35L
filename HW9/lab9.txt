git log > git-log.txt
git tag > git-tags.txt

   gets a log of changes and tags, outputting them to external files as

emacs git-log.txt
C-s 'like this'
(copy the commit id)
git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

   gets the patch that is associated with the commit id associated with the
   'like this' changes and examines it to decide how to patch it (i.e. prefix)

git checkout v3.0

   moves the head to the v3.0 version

patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

   patches the given commit

emacs (all non c files)
C-x v u

   reverts all changes to non c files

emacs (all c files)
C-x v =
C-c C-c (on each hunk)
C-u C-c C-a (on each change in comments)

   opens up the vc-diff file, where changes are described
   on each described change (i.e. a hunk), go to the line specified
   if the line specified is within a commented region,
   then revert the change

emacs src/diff.c.rej
emacs diff.c
C-s ` and replace each instance not in a comment to '
emacs src/diff3.c.rej
emacs diff3.c
C-s ` and replace each instance not in a comment to '

   these are manual changes that we are forced to do to a failing
   in the previous patching process (due to line discrepencies)

git clean -f

   removes the newly added (untracked) files

   as we can see, there are only six files changed, which is
   consistent with the spec

./bootstrap
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
make check

   builds the diffutils file to create the diff executable

diff . -
diff --help

   makes sure that all instances of ` have been changed to '

cd diffutils
cp ./src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0-patch
mv diffutils diffutils-patch
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git
cd diffutils
git checkout v3.0

   creates the original version 3.0
   
cp ./src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0
cd ..
diffutils2/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt

   creates the sanity check file

diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt

   compares the two files.
   all differences are innocuous
