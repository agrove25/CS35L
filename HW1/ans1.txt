1. man -K *search term*
2. /bin/cp and /bin/ls
3. "l" -- runs the ls program that "lists directory contents"
   "w" -- shows who is logged on and what they are doing
4. /etc/alternatives/emacs
5. g+s:
   
   makes it so that a file, for users who are members of the file's group, to 
   have all files that are created to be utilizing the same permissions as 
   those that of the directory's group permission.

   o-x:
   
   so that users that are neither part of the file's group nor the owner of 
   said file is unable to execute the given file.

6. find -ctime -21

12. C-M-a :: runs the command beginning-of-defun
	b :: runs the command backward-sexp
	c :: runs the command exit-recursive-edit
	d :: runs the command down-list
	e :: runs the command move-end-of-line
	f :: runs the command forward-sexp
	g :: is undefined
	h :: runs the command mark-defun

13. runs the command keyboard-quit (deselects any selected text and 
    interrupts a command like C-x).
14. pastes a selected text that was previously cut
15. the default colors that correspond with the type of file are different

Exercise 1:

9. No
10. Instead of holding down C-n, you can use the search capabilities like C-s or C-r
    alternatively, you can use C-u *integer* *command* to repeat the same
    command *integer times*

Exercise 4:

8. 7

Exercise 5:

#include <stdio.h>
int
main (void)
{
  char n = '\n';
  char b = '\\';
  char q = '"';
  char const *p = "#include <stdio.h>%cint%cmain (void)%c{%c  char n = '%cn';%c  char b = '%c%c';%c  char q = '%c';%c  char const *p = %c%s%c;%c  printf (p, n, n, n, n, b, n, b, b, n, q, n, q, p, q, n, n, n, n);%c  return 0;%c}%c";
  printf (p, n, n, n, n, b, n, b, b, n, q, n, q, p, q, n, n, n, n);
  return 0;
}

Exercise 6:

4. It is incorrect
5. The output is in the buffer area, rather than the scratch file itself
6. No. Some numbers are more favored than others, as it is not truly random. 
Instead, it uses a seed that causes such numbers to appear more often during 
the early stages of the random generator running
