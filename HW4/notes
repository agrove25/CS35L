df -l

tmp and ~ are put on different hard drives, with different bit amount
tmp is 64 bit, which allows it to print
while ~ is 32 bit, which causes an underflow

gdb ./ls
run
run -lt
run -lt /tmp/Lab04/

open ls.C
     search for qsort (line 3034)
     search for func decleration
     search for compare_mtime (line 2975)
     search for cmp_mtime (line 2877)

     search for timespec_cmp (unable to find, so need to look for libraries)
     	    grep timespec_cmp *.c
	    grep timespec_cmp *.h
	    grep timespec_cmp */*.h
	    found in lib/timespec.h
	    
     seach fro cmp

open lib/timespec.h
     find timespec_cmp
     problem lies here

corresponding gdb
     break ls.c:3034
     watch func
     display func


sorting the encrypted file, not the decryted file :/
   therefore, decrypt within the sort.c, but only the lines necessary to compare
   then qsort?
   qsrt(__, __, __, __), where the first three is list of encrypted strings and fourth is func
   func has to compare encrypted strings (str1, str2)
   int comp(const void *a, const void *b)
       char *sa = (char**)a
       char *sb = (char**)b

       // then we compare XOR42 values sa[i] and sb[i]
   newline is space, break the file between all the spaces
