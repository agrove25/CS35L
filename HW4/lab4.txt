tar -zxvf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
    unpacks the coreutils file

cd coreutils-with-bug
    changes the directory to the coreutils-with-bug folder

./configure
    configures the file, setting it up for make

make
    encounters an error (due to difference in the function "futimens")

wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
    downloads the patch (named coreutils.diff)

patch p0 <coreutils.diff
    patches and fixes these errors, along with some others within files:
       utimens.c
       utimens.h
       copy.c
       tee.c
       touch.c

./configure
make
   remakes the files (which this time, compiles correctly)

cd ..
mkdir testFolder
cd testFolder
touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
   creates a file that has a date of 1918
   
touch now
   creates a file with the present date
   
sleep 1
touch now1
   creates a file with the present date (1 second later from the previous)

cd ..
coreutils-with-bug/src/ls testFolder -lt
   realizes there's a bug with the sorting of the dates (the 1918 file is
   put at the newest point)

emacs coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -nw
   opens up the coreutils file

C-s qsort (found on line 3034)
   we look for this method because this is function that will finally sort the input
   use gdb to find the func parameter
      open gdb to the corresponding file: gdb ./ls
      break ls.c:3034
      run -lt ../../testFolder
      watch func
      display func
      finds the called function "compare_mtime"

C-s compare_mtime (line 2975)
   finds a called function "cmp_mtime"

C-s cmp_mtime (line 2877)
   finds a called function "timespec_cmp"

C-s timespec_cmp (n/a)
   unable to find an implementation for this method

C-x C-c
   cd coreutils-with-bug

grep timespec_cmp */*.h
   find an implementation in lib/timespec.h

emacs lib/timespec.h -nw
   find a possible error within the timespec.h, where they utilize subtraction.
   this could possibly result in an integer overflow, if the first time is low while the
   second time is high.

   we remedy this by following documentation, and changing the subtraction into:
      int diff;
      if (a.tv_sec > b.tv_sec) diff = 1;
      else if (a.tv_sec == b.tv_sec) diff = 0;
      else diff = -1;

C-x C-s
C-x C-c
make
   remake the file, with the changes implemented

cd ..
coreutils-with-bug/src/ls testFolder -lt
   re-attempt the ls, and find that wwi-armistice is now sorted correctly

mv coreutils-with-bug coreutils-with-bug-2
tar -zxvf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
cd coreutils-wth-bug
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
patch p0 <coreutils.diff
./configure
make
   setting up to find use the diff command on the original timespec.h file

cd ..
diff -u coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h coreutils-with-bug-2/lib/timespec.h > lab4.diff
    creates the required diff file (that can be used to patch things in the future)
