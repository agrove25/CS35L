Creating the 10,000,000 floating point number file:

od -tf -N 80000000 < /dev/urandom |
sed s/"^[0-9]* *"// |
sed "s/  */ /g" |
tr ' ' '\n' > test

"od -tf -N 80000000 < /dev/urandom" : takes 80000000 bytes of data, i.e. 10000000 * 8
    bytes per float, from the urandom file, formatting them in textdump format

"sed s/"^[0-9]* *"//" : removes the byte index from each beginning of the file (along
   with unecessary spaces)

"sed "s/  */ /g" : removes all spaces, replacing them with just a single space

"tr ' ' '\n' > test" : replaces all spaces (of which there is only onee of between
   numbers) with a newline
